# Access-Buddy

## Getting Started
Clone or download the project.

In your terminal, navigate into `accessbuddy/fontend` and run `npm install` 
<br>
Next, navigate into `accessbuddy/backend` and run `npm install`
<br>

In the root directory (accessbuddy) run `npm start` and it should start running on localhost:3000. If this doesn't open the app automatically in your browser, you can go to the address yourself and should find it there.
